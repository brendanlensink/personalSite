    <p>Another year, another half-baked place to host this, another top 10 list.</p>

    <h1>10. Tyler, the Creator - CALL ME IF YOU GET LOST</h1>
    <p></p>

    <h1>9. Slowthai - TYRON</h1>
    <p></p>

    <h1>8. Parquet Courts - Sympathy for Life</h1>
    <p></p>

    <h1>7. Illuminati hotties - Let Me Do One More</h1>
    <p>While this album isn't the most approachable, I think it has some very high highs.</p>

    <h1>6. Ariel View - Bury My Head</h1>
    <p>While their previous album, Until My Lungs Are Cleared, was on one of my previous top 10 lists, looking back it should have been a lot higher. These girls rock, and this album is no different.</p>

    <h1>5. Men I Trust - Untourable Album</h1>
    <p>Sad girl fall has spilled into every season this year, yet again. Men I Trust has quickly become one of my favourite bands of all time, so I guess it isn't suprising that their newest album made this list.</p>
    
    <h1>4. ILDES - The Beachland Ballroom</h1>
    <p>Another Tiny Desk alumnus, I can't resist the pure energy and passion IDLES put into their music.</p>
    
    <h1>3. Doja Cat - Planet Her</h1>
    <p>I'm not ashamed to admit that sometimes, when I really need to get work done, I would just turn on Juicy and listen to it back, to back, to back, to back, to back, to back.... ad infinitum. This was my introduction to Doja Cat and I haven't really cooled on her since. Some very solid features from Youn Thug, Ariana Grande and best of all, SZA, make for a fantastic pop album.</p>
    
    <h1>2. Silk Sonic - An Evening with Silk Sonic
    <p>I'd expect that a lot of people's introduction to Anderson .Paak was his absolutely incredible Tiny Desk Concert, and I was no exception. Since then I've been a big fan, and hearing about his collaboration with Bruno Mars had me all sorts of interested. I'm not a huge fan of Bruno Mars, but there's no denying the man can sing. The two of them together is everything I had hoped for an more, blending funk with Anderson's exceptional drumming and Bruno's vocal chops.</p>
    
    <h1>1. Black Country, New Road - For the first time</h1>
    <p>Math-y, noise-y rock isn't usually my cup of tea, but these English kids have got something special here. They blend sections of frenetic noise, </p>
